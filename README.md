# Introduction

IT helpdesk agents often deal with a high volume of repetitive tickets, many of which have been resolved before with minor variations. However, support agents donâ€™t always have visibility into past solutions, leading to redundant work and slower response times.

This repository introduces an AI-driven solution to enhance helpdesk efficiency by leveraging historical ticket data. By analyzing previously resolved tickets, this system intelligently suggests relevant past solutions for new incoming tickets, helping support agents resolve issues faster and more effectively.
